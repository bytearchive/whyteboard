How to build Whyteboard.
0.42 - 29 October 2011

 Windows
 -------

  - Run "build.bat" to create the .exe file from the program's source code.

  - Run "binaries.bat" to create the installer, and package the files neatly
    into .zip files.

  - release.bat is mainly for me, as the coder to automate away as much
    work for releasing a new version as possible.


 Linux
 ------

  - binaries.sh generates a .tar.gz archive of the program's source code, and uses
    that to create a .deb package

  - release.sh does some stuff such as updating versioning information and updates
    the file on whyteboard's website that's used to check for program updates. again,
    this is mainly a scipt for me to automate stuff.



See each script for further details; they mostly execute system commands and 
call a few Python scripts. Check the scripts folder to see what's up: they're 
mostly simple scripts with comments explaining what's going on.


Pylint requirements:

Download these, and run "python setup.py install" for each of them
