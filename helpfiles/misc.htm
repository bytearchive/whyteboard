<h2>Miscellaneous Tips</h2>
<h3>Things you may not know</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>

<h4>The History Viewer</h4>
From the View menu, selecting the "History viewer" will bring up the replay dialog. Pressing play will start to re-play your drawing history from the currently selected sheet. This is most noticeable with the Pen tool.
<hr>

<h4>Drag and Drop</h4>
Any file type Whyteboard supports can be dragged and dropped into the drawing panel to be loaded, rather than through the Open file dialog.
<hr>

<h4>Scrolling the canvas with the mouse</h4>
By holding down your mouse's middle button, you can scroll around the canvas without needing to use the scrollbars.
<hr>

<h4>Collapsing the side panels</h4>
The tool bar and thumbnail/notes panels have a button at their top with an arrow on it; clicking this folds the panel into the side of the application, showing more room in the drawing panel.
<hr>

<h4>Copy and Paste</h4>
Using the RectSelect tool, regions may be selected to be copied as a bitmap. This can then be pasted into other applications. Similarly, Whyteboard can paste in bitmap data stored on the clipboard.
<hr>

<h4>Renaming your sheets</h4>
A sheet can be right-clicked upon in the tab view (under the tool bar icons) and renamed.
<hr>

<h4>Undoing a closed sheet</h4>
Whyteboard remembers your last 10 closed sheets - if you accidentally closed one then you may open it again from the Sheets menu.
<hr>

<h4>Editing a Note</h4>
From the Notes tab in the right-hand panel, a note can be edited by double clicking upon it, or right clicking and selecting "edit". The edit can be cancelled at any time. Also, a Sheet in the tree view can be "jumped" to by double clicking it, or right clicking and selecting "switch to".
<hr>

<h4>Exporting your Image</h4>
From the File menu, the Export menu item will save the current sheet's drawing as an image to your hard drive. This can be also accessed by right clicking a sheet in the tab view.
<hr>

<h4>Saving your files</h4>
Your currently selected: tool, colour, thickness and selected sheet are saved into the .wtbd file.
<hr>

<h4>Clearing Sheets</h4>
There are 4 sheet clearing options: clear drawings/clear sheet/clear all drawings/clear all sheets.
<br /><br /><ul>
 <li><b>Clear drawings</b>: This will remove any annotations, but keep any images. </li>
 <li><b>Clear sheet</b>: Removes everything. </li>
</ul><br /><br />
The "all" option applies the clearing to every sheet. These can be undone, but the "all" option must have each sheet selectively restored; undoing clearing all will only restore the currently selected sheet.
