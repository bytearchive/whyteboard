---- NEW FEATURES ----

see: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/whyteboard

* Improvements for whiteboard pen usage: accepting certain commands to perform
  program shortcuts (e.g. new/close tab, clear sheet etc; sent via a tool like
  ZScreen)
* Adding all whiteboard-related resources (pasted images, exported sheets, etc)
  into a single folder where all the relevant data is saved together (like
  saving a web page)
* Drag / drop items in the Shape Viewer to rearrange them
* Paste text, essentially creating Text objects from the clipboard. May need
  to modify the current text method to allow RTF, so different sections of text
  can have its own font/style/colour
* "Zoom" capability; zoom in and out of the canvas. May be quite difficult to
  make...
* UI changes as the left panel takes up some space

Eventually, long term:

* Network support w/ Twisted (a Python library)
* Poppler support for better PDF rendering - no need to use ImageMagick.
  - Problems with Windows here though, Linux is more compatible.
* Improved drawing with anti-aliased graphics, including transparency
* Slider bar to "move" back/forwards through a drawing's timeline in a replay,
  as well as being able to jump to the start/end
