---- FIXES ----

undo/redo menubar/toolbar icons get disabled/renabled when there's nothing to
undo or redo

the rest are to do with the text input - see README.

---- NEW FEATURES ----

-- When converting a PDF with ImageMagick, create thumbnails for a side panel
   which allows you to jump quickly from page to page.
  -- The same applies to ps files

---- IMPROVEMENTS AND THOUGHTS ----

-- Make the slider in the history dialog move forward/backwards through the
   pen replay

-- Make a loaded PDF/PS the background image, thus everything gets written over
   that image
    -- Needs to be done for single "page" images, is currently working on multi
       page PDFs
    -- can be done, but forces -all- drawings over -every- image
        -- loading in an image over any drawn text will overwrite it..

-- Option for keeping or removing temporary files and converting on file load
