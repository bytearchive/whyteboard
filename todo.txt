*** FIXES ***

-- Loading/saving .wtdb files - should mark roughly the 0.3 release
-- Scrollbars
-- Ensure "blank" shapes aren't being added


*** NEW FEATURES ***

-- When converting a PDF with ImageMagick, create thumbnails for a side panel
   which allows you to jump quickly from page to page.
  -- The same applies to ps files

*** IMPROVEMENTS AND THOUGHTS ***

-- Make the slider in the history dialog move forward/backwards through the
   pen replay

-- Make a loaded PDF/PS the background image, thus everything gets written over
   that image
    -- Needs to be done for single "page" images, currently working on multi
       page PDFs
