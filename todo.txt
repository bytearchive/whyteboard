Whyteboard 0.25 - To do list
Mon 09 Feb 2009 01:28:57 GMT


*** NEW FEATURES ***

-- When converting a PDF with ImageMagick, create thumbnails for a side panel
   which allows you to jump quickly from page to page.
  -- In turns, this needs to have an MDI interface looked into, tabs are
     feasible but aren't as viable as having one full-screen (excluding
     the control/thumbnail panel) panel, and scrolling between each panel
  -- The same applies to ps/gs files


*** IMPROVEMENTS AND THOUGHTS ***


-- Make the slider in the history dialog move forward/backwards through the
   pen replay
  -- Make the stop button stop it as this can crash the program currently.
  -- Improve the interface for it a bit, probably no need for forward/back
     buttons.

-- Make a loaded PDF/PS the background image, thus everything gets written over
   that image.

-- Load in PDF/PS: Capture ls file (not dir) count, create temp files, get new
   count - then save in the filepath of the file that was loaded. When the app
   terminates then, remove all temporay images; when a saved whyteboard file is
   loaded, re-create the temporary image from the existing filename
  -- Downside is that if the file is removed, renamed or moved then the link is
     broken.
  -- Alternative method - save the temporary image files to a directory created
     somewhere..(where?) - obvious downside is disk usage over muliple file
     loads. Could perhaps intelligently monitor/allow a set preference to max.
     disk space usage/number of temporarily files/allow as many temporary files
     as [x] many files need it...or something
  -------- NEARLY


-- More pycallgraph to see function overheads in current implementation.
  -- [currently much much much improved]



OVERALL:
 - fix things broken at the expense of cleaner/easier to maintain code for
    this version
