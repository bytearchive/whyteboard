---- TO FIX ----

- flood fill not being rendered when scrolling/maximising window, need to find
  a less "costly" implementation

- image outline when drawing rectangles on Windows not clearing propelry
- all others fixes involve text input - see README.

---- NEW FEATURES ----

-- When converting a ifle with ImageMagick, create thumbnails for a side panel
   which allows you to jump quickly from page to page.
   - May make them a copy of the Whyteboard tab, not thumbs of the PNG files -
     so when you draw it will update the thumbnails.
   - This may be computationally demanding, to take a memory screenshot of each
     tab, i.e. to scale a tab down and created a BMP'd button for 50 tabs

---- IMPROVEMENTS AND THOUGHTS ----

-- Make the slider in the history dialog move forward/backwards through the
   pen replay

-- Make a loaded PDF/PS the background image, thus everything gets written over
   that image
    -- Needs to be done for single "page" images, is currently working on multi
       page PDFs
    -- can be done, but forces -all- drawings over -every- image
        -- loading in an image over any drawn text will overwrite it..

-- Option for keeping or removing temporary files and converting on file load
