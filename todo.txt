*** FIXES ***

all to do with the text - see README.

*** NEW FEATURES ***

-- When converting a PDF with ImageMagick, create thumbnails for a side panel
   which allows you to jump quickly from page to page.
  -- The same applies to ps files

*** IMPROVEMENTS AND THOUGHTS ***

-- Make the slider in the history dialog move forward/backwards through the
   pen replay

-- Make a loaded PDF/PS the background image, thus everything gets written over
   that image
    -- Needs to be done for single "page" images, is currently working on multi
       page PDFs

-- Option for keeping or removing temporary files and converting on file load
