*** NEW FEATURES ***

-- When converting a PDF with ImageMagick, create thumbnails for a side panel
   which allows you to jump quickly from page to page.
  -- The same applies to ps files

*** IMPROVEMENTS AND THOUGHTS ***

-- Make the slider in the history dialog move forward/backwards through the
   pen replay
  -- Make the stop button stop it as this can crash the program currently.
  -- Improve the interface for it a bit, probably no need for forward/back
     buttons.

-- Make a loaded PDF/PS the background image, thus everything gets written over
   that image
    -- Needs to be done for single "page" images, currently working on multi
       page PDFs

OVERALL:
 - fix things broken at the expense of cleaner/easier to maintain code for
    this version
