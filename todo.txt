---- TO FIX ----

- flood fill not being rendered when scrolling/maximising window, need to find
  a less "costly" implementation

---- NEW FEATURES ----

-- see: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/whyteboard
- Improved file sharing
- History slider to jump through slide's replay
- Rename tabs, undo tab close


---- IMPROVEMENTS AND THOUGHTS ----


-- Make a loaded PDF/PS the background image, thus everything gets written over
   that image
    -- Needs to be done for single "page" images, is currently working on multi
       page PDFs
    -- can be done, but forces -all- drawings over -every- image
        -- loading in an image over any drawn text will overwrite it..

-- Option for keeping or removing temporary files and converting on file load
