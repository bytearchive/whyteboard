---- NEW FEATURES ----

see: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/whyteboard

* Improvements for whiteboard pen usage: accepting certain commands to perform
  program shortcuts (e.g. new/close tab, clear sheet etc; sent via a tool like
  ZScreen)
* Drag / drop items in the Shape Viewer to re-arrange them
* Rich Text Control, allowing any part of text to be bolded/coloured differently
  to other parts of the text, as opposed to a single colour/font/style.
* "Zoom" capability; zoom in and out of the canvas. May be quite difficult to
  make...
* UI changes as the left panel takes up some space

Eventually, long term:

* Network support w/ Twisted (a Python library)
* Poppler support for better PDF rendering - no need to use ImageMagick.
  - Problems with Windows here though, Linux is more compatible.
* Improved drawing with anti-aliased graphics, including transparency
* Slider bar to "move" back/forwards through a drawing's timeline in a replay,
  as well as being able to jump to the start/end
