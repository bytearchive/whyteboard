---- NEW FEATURES ----

see: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/whyteboard

- Improvements for whiteboard pen usage: accepting certain commands to perform
  program shortcuts (sent via a tool like ZScreen)
- Adding all whiteboard-related resources (pasted images, exported sheets, etc)
  into a single folder where all the relevant data is saved together (like
  saving a web page)
- Paste text, essentially creating Text objects.

Eventually, long term:

 - Network support w/ Twisted (a Python library)
 - Poppler support for better PDF rendering - no need to use ImageMagick
 - Slider bar to "move" back/forwards through a drawing's timeline in a replay,
   as well as being able to jump to the start/end
