<h2>Drawing with Whyteboard</h2>
<p>Whyteboard provides a number of different drawing tools. This page will catalogue them and their usage.</p><br /><br />

<ul>
<li><b>Pen</b>: A free-style pen. "Ink" will appear wherever you drag your mouse while holding down the left button.<br /></li>

<li><b>Rectangle</b>: A transparent rectangle. Clicking the mouse will set the initial starting point for the rectangle; holding the mouse button down and dragging the mouse will resize the rectangle in the direction the mouse is going. So, if you drag the mouse downwards and to the left, you will extend the rectangle in that direction. Dragging it to the top right would make the rectangle smaller until you reach the original location you clicked, and then the rectangle would increase in size to the top right. <br /></li>

<li><b>Line</b>: as above, but with a straight line. <br /></li>

<li><b>Ellipse</b>: A "squashed" rectangle, creating an oval. This behaves exactly as drawing a rectangle. <br /></li>

<li><b>Circle</b>: The initial mouse click sets the position for the centre of the circle, and dragging the mouse out will increase its radius; dragging the mouse in decreases it. <br /></li>

<li><b>Text</b>: Clicking will pop up a text input dialog which you can enter text into, and select your font. Text can be multi-lined and as long as you want; Whyteboard will update its scrollbars' length/height if the text is longer/wider than Whyteboard's current size. <br /></li>

<li><b>Note</b>: Similar to text, yet is displayed with a light yellow background, to mimic a sticky/"post-it" note. <a href="notes.htm">There are further details on notes here</a>. <br /></li>

<li><b>Rounded Rectangle</b>: As a rectangle, but with rounded edges. <br /></li>

<li><b>Eyedropper</b>: This will set the current drawing colour as the colour underneath the mouse click. Be careful, often you can set your colour to white (the background colour) and get the appearance that you're drawing nothing (since you're drawing white onto white) <br /></li>

<li><b>Bitmap Select</b>: Selects a region of the canvas to be copied. Once a selection has been made, it can be copied (ctrl+C / edit->copy), and then pasted (ctrl-V/ / edit->paste) as an image. The selection may also be pasted into a new sheet. If anything is drawn after a selection has been made, but not copied, then the selection is removed. <br /></li>

<li><b>Select Tool</b>: This allows you to select most drawn shapes and to resize or move the shape. When the Select tool is chosen, when placed over a shape, the cursor will change to a hand to indicate a shape may be moved. If placed at the edge of the shape then it may be resized by clicking on its selection "handles".<br /><br />
The colour and thickness of the shape may be changed too, by selecting a shape and selecting a new thickness/colour.<br /></li>
</ul>
