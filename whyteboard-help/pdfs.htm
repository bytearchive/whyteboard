<h2>Importing PDF, Postscript and SVG files</h2>
<p>When you first try and load in a PDF/PS or SVG file, if you are using Windows, Whyteboard prompts for the location of the ImageMagick folder. This is usually in the C:/Program Files/ImageMagick-[version] directory; a directory selector dialog will allow you to choose its location.</p>

<p>Once found, Whyteboard saves the location so you don't have to specify it each time. When you load in a PDF, the file is passed off to the convert application in the background, and you must wait until the operation finishes.</p>

<p>The trouble here is that there is no way to gauge the progress of the convert, as the application does not return any information about its progress, nor can the PDF be queried to determine how many pages it has. The more pages inside a PDF, the longer it will take to convert and to refresh Whyteboard's thumbnails for every sheet. </p>
