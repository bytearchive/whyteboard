<h2>Saving Annotations</h2>
<p>When you save a Whyteboard file, it does not store the actual image data inside the application, but references the paths the images and PDF files are located at. This is currently a problem in sharing .wtbd files, since the file paths will vary from one user's computer to another.</p>

<p>When you load in .wtbd file, it may take a while to load as all the thumbnails need to be refreshed, which can take a few seconds; depending mainly on how many sheets are contained in the saved file.</p>

<p>There is also some program data saved with each .wtbd file: currently selected tool/colour/sheet and the names of all renamed sheets.<br />
This allows a user to carry on from where they were last editing their file.</p>
