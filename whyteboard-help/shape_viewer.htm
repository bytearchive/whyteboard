<h2>Shape Viewer</h2>

<h4>Overview</h4>
The shape viewer allows you to see and manage the order, and properties of each sheet's drawn items.

<hr>

<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>From the View Menu, select Shape Viewer to bring up a dialog displaying a list of all drawn items for the current sheet.<br /> 
Items at the top of the list are drawn on top of other items below it.</p> 

<p>The buttons can be used to move the shapes' position in the list: they are "move to top", "move up", "move down", "move to bottom".<br /> 
There is also buttons for changing to the next/previous sheet, and a drop-down menu for quickly jumping to any sheet.</p>

<p>A list of each drawn item is shown, as well as its thickness and colour (may be an RGB value) attributes. Additional properties are displayed, 
for example a text entry will display its text.<br /></p> 

<p>Buttons are enabled/disabled as appropriate - for example, selecting the shape at the bottom of the list disables the "move to bottom" and 
"move down" buttons, since they cannot be moved down any further.</p>

<h4>A Note on the Select Tool</h4>

<p>When you select an item with the Select tool, it is brought to the front of the list temporarily.<br />
When you deselect. draw or select a new shape, the old shape is drawn back in its correct position.</p>
