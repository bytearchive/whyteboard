<h1>The Media Player</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
Whyteboard can embed audio and video files onto its canvas, which can then be repositioned.


<h3>Creating a panel</h3>
<p>
Select the Media Player tool and click on the canvas to create a blank panel.
Click the "open file" button to select what file you would like to import. A variety of audio and video formats are supported.
</p>

<p>You may have as many media players as you want</p>

<h3>Repositioning the media player</h3>

<p>Use the select tool to drag the panel around.</p>

<h3>Deleting the media player</h3>
<p>Use the select tool to click on the panel, and the "Delete" icon will become enabled on the toolbar. Clicking it will remove the panel (or menu Shapes->Delete, or the Delete key).</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> You cannot undo deleting and repositioning the media player.</p>


<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>On certain Linux systems, wxPython may not have been configured with support for the Media Control.
This means that you cannot use the media player until you fix your wxPython configuration.</p>

<p>There is more information about this on the wxPython mailing list archive at http://wxpython-users.1045709.n5.nabble.com/MediaCtrl-td2347796.html.</p>
