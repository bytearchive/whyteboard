---- TO RUN WHYTEBOARD ----

If you have installed the Windows .exe file, simply run Whyteboard from the
start menu.

Otherwise, here are the requirements:

* Python - 2.5.4 or 2.6.3 (untested on others, but probably should work)
* wxPython - latest version is recommended (currently 2.8.10.1)
* ImageMagick, possibly GhostScript for Windows users (optional)

http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/ - Windows users may need this for ImageMagick

***

Run whyteboard.py or gui.py to launch the application, no installation needed!
If nothing happens, try launching one of the scripts from the console:

$ python whyteboard.py
